3.19.13 Conditional Imports
Use conditional imports only in exceptional cases where the additional imports needed for type checking must be avoided at runtime. This pattern is discouraged; alternatives such as refactoring the code to allow top-level imports should be preferred.

Imports that are needed only for type annotations can be placed within an if TYPE_CHECKING: block.

Conditionally imported types need to be referenced as strings, to be forward compatible with Python 3.6 where the annotation expressions are actually evaluated.
Only entities that are used solely for typing should be defined here; this includes aliases. Otherwise it will be a runtime error, as the module will not be imported at runtime.
The block should be right after all the normal imports.
There should be no empty lines in the typing imports list.
Sort this list as if it were a regular imports list.
import typing
if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:
  import sketch
def f(x: "sketch.Sketch"): ...
